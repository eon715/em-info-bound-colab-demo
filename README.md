# EM Informational Bound – Colab Toy Demo

This repository contains a lightweight Google Colab notebook demonstrating:
- toy electromagnetic-like field generation
- estimation of an information proxy from field snapshots
- evaluation of a bound margin derived from a patent-pending framework

## What this is
A conceptual, reproducible validation demo intended to show operational feasibility.

## What this is not
This is not a high-fidelity Maxwell solver and does not constitute experimental validation.

## How to run
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run all cells top to bottom.
